            <h3>About us</h3>
            <p>We're known more by the impact we create
                than the titles we hold. Impact that is brought by
                working together on audacious challenges at scale
                with an aim to revolutionize for the Indian customer.
                We believe great ideas can emerge from anywhere
                and must be backed. Our people - backed by our
                culture of end-to-end ownership - have revolutionised
                India's e-commerce sector - several times over!</p>
            <p>Our journey of building India's biggest unicorn
                start-up has been full of successes, but also failures
                and learning from them. That's why there's calculated
                risk-taking, a high willingness to learn and improvise,
                and a growth orientation built into everything we do.
                Whether it be opening a new warehouse, or making
                our mobile app a bit more consumer friendly, we're
                always experimenting, learning and growing!</p>
            <h3>Work With The Best</h3>
            <p>The best people make the best teams. And we put all
                our efforts into finding the right people that fit into
                our high-performing inclusive teams. Everyone has a
                voice on the table and diversity of thoughts, styles
                and actions is celebrated. From a category leader to a
                wishmaster, we are all bound together and guided by
                our values of audacity, bias for action, customer-first,
                integrity and inclusion.</p>
            <h3>We Care</h3>
            <p>Our culture of care extends to our people,
                stakeholders, customers and the planet! We do not
                believe in a one size fits all strategy. Our benefits and
                care policies are driven by empathy and customised
                to the unique needs of individual Flipsters. Because
                when Flipsters and their families are cared for, they
                can focus on doing their best work. We put your
                hopes, dreams and endeavours first - always.</p>
